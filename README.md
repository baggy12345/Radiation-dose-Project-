When I was on a trip to Mongolia in the winter of 2023 my family had me take x-rays which I felt was unnecessary.
They had said that it was fine but I felt it was better to not do it without x-ray so I created a small quick project on the side while pretty new to programming to show them the approximate dose.
This was inspired by a video I watched on Veritasium on radiation doses and I was suprised to see x-rays were equivalent to spending time in chernobyl and how much radiation smoking gave you.
Feel free to comment and provide suggestions to improve my code!!!
